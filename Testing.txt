Once Mom and Dad got together it seems that Mom took responsibility for the photos and putting the albums together. However Dad seemed to latch onto the idea that slides were the way to go.  So he took slide photos and had a slide projector and kept the slides in a metal slides case.  I have memories of looking at the slides once or twice with a projector but I presume it packed up, or the bulb was very expensive to replace and so those images were basically lost. I remember on odd occasions we would try look at them by holding them up to the light but we would lose interest very quickly. Mom faithfully kept them all and probably never ever looked at them. Now with a digital scanner I have converted them all and can share them like any other photo. So in the next posts I'll include these photos which fill in quite a lot of the gaps between Mom and Dad's 1st albums respectively to the time when Mom started creating her album collection.

I'll try to keep these pictures in chronological order as best as possible, there is no way to annotate slides as conveniently as a physical photo album allows and the order of these slides were totally disarranged.&nbsp; I'm sure that every time someone opened the slide case they opened it upside down and caused all the slides to fall out, and it takes ages to put all the slides back in their individual slots.

So for starters here are some "colour" pictures of a holiday in Uvongo that Mom also has pictures in her first album which is in black and white.
